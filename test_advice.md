# Test Advice
Here is a compilation of test taking advice I found.
# Strategy
## Time To Take
I found starting earlier in the morning, the network is fastest. This is clutch when doing the initial network scans
## Order
1. Scan all the hosts with `nmapAutomater`
2. Bang out the buffer overflow
3. Start the hard one for a few hours. Set a timer
4. Break
5. Start the medium one for a few hours. Set a timer
6. Break
7. Start the next two easy ones. Set a timer
8. Break
9. Assess the situation
    * See how many points are needed and prioritize
    * Stuff you've never seen before, deprioritize since it will likely take more time
    * Assess for each incomplete box look at current path and the paths ignored
        * Re-assess the paths not taken starting with the hardest box (.e.g the one farthest in the past)
            * This will help provide 'new eyes' on the issue
        * Start working through again attempting these alternative paths.
## General - From Other People
Notes froms blogs, twitter, etc on what people recommend for taking the exam.
1. OSCP Examp is really hard
2. Everything on the box is there for a reason
    * Write everything you find down, even if it doesn't seem like anything. That tiny thing might be.
3. Take breaks - Physically walk away and change thought processes to Not-OSCP to break out of rabbit holes. **Rubber Duck your approaches**
    * Breaks
    * Eat
    * Sleep


# Setup
Find a desktop recording software. Still take screenshots, but incase you miss something, either in the documentation or screenshots, youll have it.
## MAC
### OBS
[OBS](https://obsproject.com/) is easy to use. Will crew up the CPU a bit though. Set the Video capture rate to 10FPS
